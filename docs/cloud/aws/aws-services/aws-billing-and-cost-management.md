# AWS Services - Billing & Cost Management

## Introduction

The **Billing & Cost Management Dashboard** in AWS provides a centralized place to manage your account’s usage,
payments, and costs.  
It allows you to view invoices, set budgets, analyze costs, and monitor your **Free Tier** usage.  
This section is accessible from the **top right corner** of the AWS Management Console under **Billing and Cost
Management**.

## Billing Dashboard

The dashboard gives an overview of:

- Current month-to-date usage and charges
- Free Tier usage alerts
- Links to invoices and payment methods
- Access to **Cost Explorer** and **Budgets**

---

## Payment Methods & Billing Preferences

- Add or update **credit/debit cards** or **bank accounts**
- Manage **billing preferences** (e.g., receiving PDF invoices by email)
- Set up **consolidated billing** if managing multiple AWS accounts under an AWS Organization

---

## Cost Explorer

The **Cost Explorer** provides detailed insights into your spending.

You can:

- View historical data for the last 12–24 months
- Break down costs by **service**, **region**, **linked account**, or **tags**
- Identify usage trends and forecast future costs
- Filter by specific services (e.g., EC2, S3) to understand spending

---

## Cost Allocation Tags

Cost allocation tags help you organize and track AWS costs by labeling resources.

- **AWS-generated tags**: Automatically created by AWS (e.g., `aws:createdBy`).
- **User-defined tags**: Custom tags you define (e.g., `Project=WebApp`, `Environment=Prod`).

**Steps to use tags for billing**:

1. Go to **Billing Console** → **Cost Allocation Tags**.
2. Activate the tags you want to use for reporting.
3. Use these tags in **Cost Explorer** or **Budgets** to filter and group costs.

**Best practice**:  
Define a consistent tagging strategy across your organization (e.g., `Project`, `Environment`, `Owner`) to make cost
reports meaningful.

## Budgets

With **AWS Budgets**, you can create customized alerts to monitor usage and costs:

- **Cost Budgets** – alert when spending exceeds a threshold
- **Usage Budgets** – monitor specific service usage (e.g., EC2 hours)
- **Reservation Budgets** – track reserved instances utilization
- Notifications can be sent via **Amazon SNS** or email

---

## Free Tier Usage

The dashboard tracks your **AWS Free Tier** usage:

- Monitors services with free limits (e.g., 750 hours of EC2 t2.micro, 5 GB of S3 storage)
- Alerts you when usage approaches Free Tier limits to prevent unexpected charges

---

## Reports & Invoices

- Download **monthly invoices** in PDF format
- Export **detailed usage reports** in CSV for analysis
- Integrate billing data with **AWS Cost and Usage Report (CUR)** for advanced analysis in Amazon Athena or Redshift

---

## Best Practices

- Always enable **Budgets** to prevent overspending
- Use **Cost Explorer** regularly to identify unused or underutilized resources
- Set up **Free Tier alerts** if you’re testing AWS services
- Consider **Consolidated Billing** for multiple accounts to optimize costs

---

## Summary

The **Billing & Cost Management Dashboard** is a key tool for keeping control of your AWS spending.  
By using features like **Cost Explorer**, **Budgets**, and **Free Tier monitoring**, you can optimize costs and prevent
unexpected charges.
